# UFW Risk-Based Blocking Script

This script integrates with the **FraudGuard.io Raw IP Lists by Risk API** to block IPs with a specified risk level using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**. It ensures that high-risk IPs are automatically added to your firewall rules.

## Features

- Risk-Based Blocking: Blocks IPs meeting or exceeding a specified risk level.
- Pagination Support: Automatically fetches IPs in batches for large lists.
- Total Count Awareness: Utilizes the `X-Total-Count` header to determine the total number of IPs available.
- Hard Limit for Testing: Configurable maximum number of IPs to process (optional).
- Rate Limiting: Includes a sleep interval to avoid overloading the API.
- Avoids Duplicate Rules: Skips IPs already blocked by UFW.
- Detailed Logs: Actions and errors are logged to `ufw_block_by_risk.log`.

## Prerequisites

1. Dependencies:
   - `curl` for API requests.
   - `jq` for parsing JSON responses.

   Install `jq` if itâ€™s not already installed:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install jq

2. FraudGuard.io Credentials:
   - Obtain your FraudGuard.io API Key username and password.

3. UFW:
   - Ensure UFW is installed and active on your server:
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install ufw
     sudo ufw enable

## Usage

1. Setup:
   - Download or copy the `block_by_risk.sh` script to your server.
   - Make the script executable:
     chmod +x block_by_risk.sh

2. Configure:
   - Open the script in a text editor and update the following variables:
     - `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`: Your FraudGuard.io API key credentials.
     - `RISK_LEVEL`: The minimum risk level of IPs to block (e.g., 5).
     - `LIMIT`: The number of IPs to fetch per request (default: 100).
     - `MAX_RESULTS`: A hard limit for the total number of IPs to process (set to 0 to disable).
     - `SLEEP_INTERVAL`: Time (in seconds) to wait between API requests.

3. Run the Script:
   - Execute the script with root privileges:
     sudo ./block_by_risk.sh

4. Logs:
   - The script logs all actions and errors to `ufw_block_by_risk.log`.
   - View the log file:
     cat ufw_block_by_risk.log

## Notes

- This script focuses on risk-based blocking but can be adapted for threat-based blocking by substituting the API URL with the `Raw IP Lists by Threat` API.
- The `X-Total-Count` header ensures the script stops when all available IPs have been processed.
